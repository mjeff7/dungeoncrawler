# Dungeon Crawler

Crawl through a dungeon with only a lamp, searching for food and weapons to defeat the monsters that crawl alongside you.
- Use arrow keys to move.
- Blue dots are weapons. You start out without one and must have a weapon to attack the monsters. The damage it does is random within the range of each given weapon, as shown while you carry it.
- Black dots are health. They restore your energy. Keep searching, as these appear over time.
- Red dots are monsters. Beware! Walking into one engages it. You attack it, and if it survives, it attacks you. If one of you runs out of energy, that one perishes! You do not know how much health a monster has.
- Defeat all the monsters to win. Perish to a monster to try again.
